The emotion extraction engine is a generic prototype based on keyword tagging and real-world knowledge. The engine classifies emotions into the following categories: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, and anger.

The user’s mood is defined as the feelings perceived from a user’s series of input in the emotion extraction engine. The current emotion of a user is based totally on the information assessed within a single sentence.

 A user’s mood may not be consistent with the current emotion of the user. For example, a user may present a sad feeling in one sentence, but previously the user was talking about happy and interesting things. The sad feeling presented may not be a significant emotion and overall the user’s mood may be still happy. To calculate the mood of a user, previous emotions and current emotions need to be analyzed together.
