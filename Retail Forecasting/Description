Retail forecasting methods anticipate the future purchasing actions of consumers by evaluating past revenue and consumer behavior over the previous months or year to discern patterns and develop forecasts for the upcoming months. Data is adjusted for seasonal trends, and then a plan for ordering and stocking products may follow the analysis. After fulfillment of current and forthcoming customer purchases and orders, an assessment of the results is compared with previous forecasts, and the entire procedure is repeated.

In retail management, forecasting serves to predict and meet the demands of consumers in retail establishments while controlling pricing and inventory. Holding excess inventory adds to overhead costs for a business. When forecasting helps the retailer to meet the demands of the customer by understanding consumer purchase patterns better, more efficient use of shelf and display space within the retail establishment is the result, in addition to optimal use of inventory space.
